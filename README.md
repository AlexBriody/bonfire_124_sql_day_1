# Amazon Mock Database

## Problem:
We were given a task to create a database capable of storing all relevant data for a transaction from Amazon. We were told what kind of info was avaialable and given free reign to create the relationships.

## Solution:

### ERD

![](/Users/alexanderbriody/Desktop/Coding Temple/Bonfire Classes/Week_5/Day_1/bonfire_124_sql_day_1/Amazon Mock ERD.png)



## Folder Structure:

- .gitignore
    - Tell git to ignore our .env file
  
- .env file
    - Not be uploaded to GitHub. This will house all our local connection variables

- create.sql
    - Table creation for us

- insert.sql
    - Insertion of data

- query.sql
    - All our sql queries

- demo.py
    - House a class that will run all of these for us at once.
